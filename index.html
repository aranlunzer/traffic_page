    <h3>Page purpose</h3>
        <p>This page hosts supplementary material for the poster <i>Exploring Simulation Scenarios with Timepoint Thumbnails</i>, presented at the IEEE Vis conference in October 2017.</p>
        <p>You can look at the <a href="extras/timepoint-thumbnails-vis2017-abstract.pdf">poster abstract</a>, and the <a href="extras/timepoint-thumbnails-vis2017-poster.pdf">poster</a> as presented at the conference.  You might also be interested in two video-representation works by Robert Ochshorn, that he says led him to the timepoint-thumbnails idea: <a href="https://rmozone.com/snapshots/2013/05/chewing.h264.mov"><i>Chewing</i></a> and <a href="https://rmozone.com/snapshots/2013/05/livezoom/"><i>livezoom</i></a>, both from 2013.

        <p>...but what we're up to here will certainly be more understandable if you watch the following video:

                <source src="img/traffic-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
